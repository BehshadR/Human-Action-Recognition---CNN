# Human Action Recognition - Image Classification Using CNN
Building an Image Classification Model using Convolutional Neural Network that classifies to which class of activity a human is performing.

* Dataset contains 15 different classes of human activities - 'calling', ’clapping’, ’cycling’, ’dancing’, ‘drinking’, ‘eating’, ‘fighting’, ‘hugging’, ‘laughing’, ‘listeningtomusic’, ‘running’, ‘sitting’, ‘sleeping’, texting’, ‘using_laptop’.
* Train folder contains over 12000 images for training the model.
* Test folder contains over 5000 images of human activities.
* Each image in training set is labeled with one of the 15 human activities, and the labels are stored in Training_set.csv file.
