# Human Action Recognition - Image Classification Using CNN
Building an Image Classification Model using Convolutional Neural Network for rice image dataset.

* Dataset contains 5 different classes of rices: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, Karacadag.
* Train folder contains over 12000 images for training the model.
* Test folder contains over 5000 images of human activities.
* Each image in training set is labeled with one of the 15 human activities, and the labels are stored in Training_set.csv file.
