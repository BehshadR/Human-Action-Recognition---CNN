# Human-Action-Recognition---CNN
Human Action Recognition by Convolutional Neural Network

* 15 different classes of Human Activities is included in dataset.
* Training set has over 12000 labelled images including the validation images.
* Each image in training set has only one human activity category and they are saved in separate folders of the labelled classes.

"Train - contains all the images that are to be used for training your model. In this folder you will find 15 folders namely - 'calling', ’clapping’, ’cycling’, ’dancing’, ‘drinking’, ‘eating’, ‘fighting’, ‘hugging’, ‘laughing’, ‘listeningtomusic’, ‘running’, ‘sitting’, ‘sleeping’, texting’, ‘using_laptop’ which contain the images of the respective human activities.

Test - contains 5400 images of Human Activities. For these images you are required to make predictions as the respective class names -'calling', ’clapping’, ’cycling’, ’dancing’, ‘drinking’, ‘eating’, ‘fighting’, ‘hugging’, ‘laughing’, ‘listeningtomusic’, ‘running’, ‘sitting’, ‘sleeping’, texting’, ‘using_laptop’."
